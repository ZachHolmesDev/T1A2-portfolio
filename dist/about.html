  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    About Me: Hi, I'm Zach Holmes, an aspiring full-stack web developer and
    cybersecurity student currently serving as the head of IT for a small
    business with 10 staff members.
  </p>
  <p>
    My journey began with a strong curiosity for problem-solving and a passion
    for creating innovative solutions. As a student of full-stack web
    development and cybersecurity pen testing, I'm committed to continuous
    learning and adapting to the latest industry trends.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a particular interest in radio mesh networks and their potential to
    enhance communication and data sharing in non-permissive environments. The
    integration of mesh radios with ATAK (Android Team Awareness Kit) presents a
    powerful solution, offering real-time situational awareness and secure,
    decentralized communication in various scenarios.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I'm not immersed in tech projects or managing IT operations, I enjoy
    exploring the great outdoors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's connect and discuss how we can leverage technology, such as mesh
    radios and ATAK, to build a safer, more connected world together.
